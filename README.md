# Unattended unipacker #

This is a fork of [unipacker](https://github.com/unipacker/unipacker) made to allow unattended unpacking (for automated unpacking without the need for user input).

## Changes ##
The functions _get_tail_jump_ and _get_entrypoint_ in ``unpackers.py``no longer ask for input from the user.
